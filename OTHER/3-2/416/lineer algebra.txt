vector norm
level 1 -> sum
level 2 -> squareroot of sum of squares
level 3 -> maxi |xi|
matrix norm -> ?
dot product -> a . b . cosx
AB+AC=A(B+C)
AB != BA
(AB)C = A(BC)
(ABC)^T = C^T B^T A^T
^T = transpose
determinant -> mapping a matrix into scalar
det(A) = 0 -> A is regular
tr -> trace -> sum of diagonal elements
tr(AB) = tr(BA)
tr(A+B) = tr(A) + tr(B) 
Skew-symmetric -> simetrik gibi ama eksili hali -> A^T = -A

Matrix transformation
scaling -> 
rotating -> 

homogeneous system -> sonuna 1 ekle
translate + rotate + scale
